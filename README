Has Lookup Extension
===================

What is it for?
===============

Rather than storing a list of things in the database as strings, e.g. Mr, Mrs 
and so on, instead we store an integer value that we can look up to get the 
true value. This is done for a number of reasons, e.g. it is easy to change the 
meaning of a code without having to update large tables, storing an integer is 
a lot less space than a string and so on. It is also easy to translate a site 
if needed, but this plugin isn't sophisticated enough to do that.

It does have some disadvantages in that you need to know what the magic number 
means and it can make writing queries a pain. The plugin has methods that will 
help with this.
